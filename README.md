# CoffeeQuick.ly
### _Know where to go to get a quick cup o' jo!_

#### About:
We wrote this project for the DevelopHer Hackday 2013. It pulls data from Foursquare to see which coffee shops near you are the least busy.

#### Future:
+ A mobile phone version is key.
+ Caching for the data that doesn't change (e.g. pictures)
+ Using data from other check in sites such as Facebook to get a better indication of how many people are at a particular place.
+ Sending a notification to the user once they get to the coffee shop alerting them to check in.
